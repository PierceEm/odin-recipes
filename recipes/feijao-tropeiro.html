<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Feijão Tropeiro translates to “Cattleman’s Beans”. I’ll explain: back in Brazil’s colonial times, troops of cattlemen – known as “tropeiros”, in Portuguese – would travel long distances to explore the inland territories of Brazil and transport cattle and commodities.</p>
<p>The expeditions were long and could last for months, so they carried certain staple provisions – that didn’t need any refrigeration – along with them, like dried beans, carne seca (salted dried meat) and manioc flour.</p>
<p>These ingredients were eventually combined into one hearty and filling dish, the Feijão Tropeiro, which since then carries the nickname of the explorers.</p>
